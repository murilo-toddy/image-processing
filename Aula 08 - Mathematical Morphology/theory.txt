MATHEMATICAL MORPHOLOGY

- Constructed using set theory
- Objects in an image are defined as sets

    Binary Images
    - Are defined by a set Z2
    - Each element of a set is a vector with coordinates (x, y) of pixels

    Grey Level Images
    - Are defined by a set Z3
    - Two components are the coordinates, and the third is the intensity


    EROSION
    - Let A and B be sets Z2, the erosion of A by B is
      A erode B = {z | Bz C A}


    OPENING AND CLOSING
        Opening
        - Smooth out the contours of the object
        - Erosion followed by dilation

        Closing
        - Smooth contours, eliminating small discontinuities
        - Dilation followed by erosion

    Combinations
    - Combinations of different operators can be used in different applications

    Hit or Miss
    - Shape detection using a structing element D
    - Erosion of A in D
    - There is the need of local background information W
      A hom B = A erode B inter comp(A) erode (W - D)

    Edge Detection
    - Diffence of A and the erosion of A with an element

    Filling
    - From a point X0 inside the edge
    - Xk = Xk-1 dilate B inter comp(A)
