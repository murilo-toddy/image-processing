FOURIER TRANSFORM
Mathematical transformation to obtain information not available directly in the original domain
Change of basis

A 1D signal is often represented in the time domain in its original form
Time x Amplitude

For images (2D signal), values are represented in space domain and are mapped to intensity

Fourier Transform
- Input: Points sampled
- Output: Coefficients that define said samples

- Analysis: Divide the signal by defining it via simpler partes
- Synthesis: Reconstruct the signal from its parts

  F(w) = sum_t f(t) e^-jwt
- Transforms image from space to frequency domain


Fourier Series
- Functions are modeled by sinusoids
- Every function of a continuous variable t with period T can be represented as
  f(t) = sum_n a_n cos(2pi n t) + sum_m b_m sin(2 pi n t) = sum_i c_i exp(j 2pi n t / T)


DFT
- Fourier transform for discrete values
  F(w) = sum_i f(t)e^(-jwt)

  for i = 0 to n-1
    cn = f(t)e^-jw_it
    F(wi) = a_wi, b_wi


    2D Fourier Transform
      f(u, v) = 1 / sqrt(mn) sum_x sum_y f(x, y) exp(-j2pi(ux/n + vy/m))
      f(x, y) = 1 / sqrt(mn) sum_x sum_y F(u, v) exp(j2pi(ux/n + vy/m))
    - x, y are image coordinates
    - F(0, 0) is related to the average value of the image
    - The DFT is invariant to translation in the original image
    - The DFT is covariant to rotation

    - After the FFTShift, the middle represents lower frequencies, while the edges represent higher freqs

- A convolution in space domain is a product in frequency domain
  f(x, y) * w(x, y) = invdft F(u, v) W(u, v)

Filters
    Low Pass Filter
    - Allow passing of low frequencies, removing higher ones

    High Pass Filter
    - Allow passing of high frequencies, removing lower ones

    Bandpass Filter
    - Selects a range of frequencies to be kept

    Bandstop Filter
    - Remove a range of frequencies


Fast Fourier Transform
- Efficient form to compute DFT
-  O(n logn)
