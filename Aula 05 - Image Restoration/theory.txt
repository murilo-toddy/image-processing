IMAGE RESTORATION

Enhancement x Restoration
    Enhancement
    - Subjective method based on operations that supposedly improve image quality

    Restoration
    - Method based on prior knowledge about the image degradation


Degradation
    Blur
    - Harder to see details about image
        Motion Blur
        - Caused my moviment of the object or camera

    Noise
    - Corruption of the pixels making them inprecise


Problem
  g(x) = N{f(x) * h(x)}
- g: Observed image
- f: Ideal image
- h: Degradation function
- N: Noise generation process
    Usually considered to be additive
    g(x) = f(x) * h(x) + n(x)

    - Each acquisition system has its own h(x)

- The objective is to find a restored image f' that is as similar as possible to f

Sources of Noise
    Photon Counting
    - Light detection via a sensor, a statistical process modeled by a poisson distribution
    - It's estimated that 1/3 of the pixels contain noise
    - The precision of the pixel is proportional to the intensity

    - A sharper image tends to be noisier
    - Signal to Noise: Ratio between amounts of noise in a signal

    - The noise is signal dependent
      g(x) = P{f(x) * h(x)}
    - As the lambda parameter gets higher, the poisson distribution can be approximated by a normal one
      P(lambda){} -> N{}

    Thermal
    - Fluctuation in the amount of photons given by generated electrons
    - Modeled by a normal distribution N and an additive noise n

        Dark Frame Capture
        - Takes a black photo to check for points of thermal additive noise
        - Levels get normalizes and removed when capturing an image

    Quantisation
    - Caused by reduction of amount of levels
    - Usually follows a uniform distribuction

    Transmission / Display
    - Impulsive / Salt and pepper noise
    - Loss of all the values of the pixel (0 or 255)
    - A small number of pixels is completly destroyed


Noise Generation
- Uses random number generations and probability functions
- Knowing something about the noise in the image, it's possible to filter said image
- It's possible to inspect the histogram of the image in places where its values are known

    Mean Filter
        Arithmetic
        - Smooth out pixels
        - Increases the blur but removes noise
          f'(x) = 1/mn sum lambda_st g(s, t)

        Geometric
        - Preserve detils when pixel differences are in multiples
          f'(x) = PI lambda_st g(s, t) ^ 1/mn

        Harmonic
        - Removes the amount of outliers

        Statistic Filters
        - Median / Maximum / Minimum / Mean

            Median
            - Preserve edges

            Max
            - Locate dark points

            Min
            - Locate light points

            Mean
            - Combines order statistics with mean
            - Thickens edges


    Adaptative Filter
    - Filter parameters change depending on the position
    - Flat regions are mantained
      f'(x) = g(x) - sigman^2 / sigmal^2 (g(x) - mL)
    sigman: Variance of noise in the whole image
    sigmal: Local variance of pixels
    mL:     Local mean of pixels

        Bilateral Filter
        - Computes a filter for each pixel of the image
          BF(g) = 1 / F sum_q G_sigmas(p - q) G_sigmar(gp - gq) gq
        - The filter only considers the image pixels that are related to the image


Blur
- Assumes a noise free scenario

  g(x) = f(x) * h(x)
- h: Impulse response of the image
    - How the system when the input is a single point
        - When we acquire a single dot, what happens to the acquired image?
    - Point Spread Function (PSF)

    - h is non-negative
    - The energy of the image is preserved
      int int h(x, y) dx dy = 1

    No Blur
    - h = delta

    Uniform Blur
    - h(x, y, R) = 1/pi RÂ²

    Motion Blur
    - h(x, y, L, phi) = 1 / L if x, y is in a certain radius and angle

    We want to invert h
    f'(x) = g(x) * h-1(x)

    - In the frequency domain
      G(u) = F(u) H(u)
      F' = G / H

    - In a noisy image
      F' = F + N / H
    - If H -> 0, noise dominates

    Pseudo Inverse Filter
    - Creates a superior threshold for H
      W = H if H < gamma
      W = gamma otherwise
