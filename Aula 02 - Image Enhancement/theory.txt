IMAGE FORMATION
Every pixel in an image is determined by an x, y component, witch corresponds to the cartesian plane rotated
90 degrees clockwise

Pixel and Neighborhood
- A pixel p at (x, y) has 4 neighbors in horizontal and vertical direcxtions, given by
    (x+1, y)
    (x-1, y)
    (x, y+1)
    (x, y-1)
    This set is the 4-neighborhood of p

    - There is also a diahgonal neighborhood, given by diagonal pixels
    - 8-neighborhood of p is the union of both sets

Intensity Transformation
- Alter the grey level of an individual pixel
    Let z be the intensity of an input pixel and T a transformation
    s = T{z}
    - s is the pixel value after transformation

    Negative Transformation
    s = 255 - z

    Contrast Modulation
    - Changes the amount of contrast in an image
    - [0, 255] -> [40, 190]
    - [40, 190] -> [0, 255]
    s = T{z} = (z-a)(d-c)/(b-a) + c

    Logarithmic Function
    - Shrinks the dynamic range
    s = c log(1 + |z|)
    c = A / log(1 + R)
        - A is the maximum gray value
        - R is the larger value in the original image

    Gamma Ajustment
    - Enhance pixels of higher intensity
    s = cz^g

    Thresholding
    - Maps the whole image to two values
    - Used to create masks
    s = 0, z > T
    s = 255, z >= T

    Slicing Gray Levels
    - Enhances only a specific part of the gray value


Histograms
- Information of frequency of each intensity in the image
- h(k), k in [0, L-1]
- Visualized using a bar plot

    Normalized Histogram
    - Each bin contains a value between 0 and 1, and it corresponds to the percentage of said intensity
    - Related to probability of selecting a color by randomly chosing a pixel at random

    Cumulative Histogram
    - For each bin, it shows how many pixels have intensity equal or smaller to said intensity

    Normalized Cumulative Histogram
    - Combination of both


    Histogram Equalization
    - Produces a non-linear mapping between input and output pixels
    - T{} uses image as basis
    - Ds = f(Dz)
    - The distribution of the output image Ds depends on the distribution of the input image

    - The cumulative histogram can be used as the transfer function
      s = T(z) = (L-1)/MN hc(z)
