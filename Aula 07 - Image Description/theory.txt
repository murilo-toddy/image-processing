IMAGE DESCRIPTION

Color and Texture
    Color Histogram
        Global Color Histogram
        - Computes a single histogram for the image, using frequency as descriptor

        Border Interior Classification
        - Computes two histograms, one for the internal pixels and one for the outer ones
            - A pixel is internal if all its edges are the same color


    Color descriptors
        Euclidian Distance
        - d = sqrt(sum(q[i] - p[i])²)

        Log Distance
        - d = sum |f(q[i]) - f(p[1])|
            - f = 0 if x = 0
            - f = 1 if 0 < x < 1
            - f = ceil(logx + 1)


    Texture
    - Local difference in intensity levels
        - Difference if the pixel levels
        - Size of regions to be considered
        - Direction

    - Pixel by pixel processing is often not a good idea

        Structural Analysis
        - Decompose image in basic elements

        Statistical Analysis
        - Characterize textures as series of statistical proprieties in a group of pixels

        - Let z represent indices of pixels in a given window, p(zi), i = 0, ..., L-1 is
          the frequency intensity zi, in witch p is a normalized histogram

        Uniformity
        - U(z) = sum(p(zi)²)

        Entropy
        - e(z) = -sum(p(zi) log(p(zi)))


        Co-Ocurence Matrix
        - Captures relationship between a pair of pixels
        - The co-ocurence matrix considers a fixed distance Q between two pixels: reference and neighbor

        - Data is stored in a matrix with cols as the value of the pixels and rows as the difference Q
        - The output matrix is often sparse

            Haralick Descriptors
            - Calculate the mean and variance of rows and cols in CM
              mr = sum i sum p_i,j
              mc = sum j sum p_i,j
              sigmar^2 = sum(i - mr)^2 sum p_i,j
              sigmac^2 = sum(i - mc)^2 sum p_i,j


            - Maximum probability: Strongest response of the matrix
              max(p_i,j)

            - Correlation: Between pixels reference and neighbour in range [-1, 1]
              sum sum (i-mr)(j-mc) p_i,j / sigmar sigmac

            - Contrast
              sum sum (i - j)^2 p_i,j

            - Energy
              sum sum p_i,j


            Local Binary Patterns
            - Texture is described by local spation patterns and greylevel contrast

            - Let P, R be the neighbourhood of a pixel with P sampling points and a circle radius R
            - Produces LBP code for a central pixel c with coordinates (xc, yc)
              LBP = sum s(gp - gc)2^p

            - A code is said to be uniform if it has low transitions


    BAG OF FEATURES
    - Extract features locally
    - Quantize or cluster the local features
    - Learn a vocabulary of visual words
    - Obtain descriptors as the frequency of visual words in an image

    - Creation of a dictionary containing universal textons (subimages / patterns to be found in images)
    - Plot of a histogram comparing image with each texton
