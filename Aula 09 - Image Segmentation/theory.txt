IMAGE SEGMENTATION

- Divide the image into parts or regions that are correlated
- Usually there are semantics involved

Definition
- Let R be the region occupied by all image
- Segmentation will partition R into n subregions R1, ..., Rn
    - URi = R
    - Ri is connected
    - Ri inter Rj = empty
    - There is a criterion Q such that
        - Q(Ri) = true
        - Q(Ri U Rj) = false
          Ri and Rj adjacent

- It's a subjective process

Methods
    Global Knowledge: Looks for tresholds in intensities
    Edge-Based: Search for discontinuities
    Region-Based: Connects pixels that are similar in a neighbourhodd
    Model-Based: Search for patterns with pre-defined model
    Connectivity-Based: Via graph or network
    PDE-Based: Numerical solution for a PDE given some criterion


    Tresholding
    - Separate pixels in regions given their intensity / color
    - Threshold can be obtained in manual or automatic method
    - Adaptative thresholding is also possible

        Otsu
        - Assumes that image has a bi-modal histogram
        - Computes optimal threshold separating intensities in two classes
            - Minimizes intra-class variance
            - Maximizess variance among classes

        - Compute histogram
        - For each intensity, compute intra-class variance sigma_w^2(i)
        - Use as threshold intensity T = arg min_i (sigma_w^2(i))
            - The intraclass variance for a threshold L of an image with M pixels is the weighted sum below
              sigma_w^2 = W_a sigma_a^2 + W_b sigma_b^2
              W = 1/M sum h(i)
              mu = sum(i h(i)) / sum h(i)
              sigma = sum((i - mu)^2 h(i)) / sum h(i)


    Edge Detection
    - Use as basis the transition of intensities
    - Search for borders of regions by looking at discontinuities
    - Application of high-pass filters
        - Laplacian
        - Sobel
        - Prewitt
    - Application of a treshold to extract edges
    - Easily degrades with variation and noise

        Laplacian
        - Isometric filter, can be altered to be directional

        Laplacian of Gaussian
        - Combination of smoothing with laplacian filter

        Sobel
        - Gives more weight to central pixels


    Region Based Segmentation
    - Find regions via pixel inspection

        Region Growing
        - From seed pixels, add pixels that have similar characteristics
        - Seeds can be set manually of based on filtering operation
        - Similarity can be achieved via difference or local statistic


    Watershed Transformation
    - Views image as topographic surface: low intensities are valleys and high intensities are hills
    - Starts by filling the valleys with different "colored water"
    - When different water meet, some barrier is used to prevent merging
    - Barriers will represent segmentation

    Hough Transform
    - Isolate features of a particular shape in an image
    - Shape must be mathematically described
