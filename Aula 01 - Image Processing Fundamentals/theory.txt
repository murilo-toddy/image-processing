IMAGE
Bidimensional function of intensity of light f(x,y)
    x and y are spation coordinates
    f(x,y) is the intensity of color in a given coordinate
    In the real world, amplitude and coordinate are continuous
    In the discrete realm, both are discrete

Image Generation Pipeline
    Camera Body
    - Optics: Lenses
    - Aperture: Amount of light that goes through
    - Shutter: Time of exposure

    Sensor Chip
    - Sensor
        CCD
        - Light is captured by the lens system
        - Charge is converted into voltage, that goes to the ADC
        - The amplification process is serial
        - All the sensors are exposed at the same time, but takes longer
        CMOS
        - Photons affect the conductivity of each cell
        - The sensor exposes one row at a time
        - Amplification is parallel, by row
    - Gain: Sensitiviness to light
    - ADC

    DSP (Digital Signal Processing)
    - Demosaic and Sharpening
    - White balance
    - Gamma / curve
    - Compression


SAMPLING AND RESOLUTION
The size of the sensor defines most of the image quality
