IMAGE FILTERING

Techniques shown so far only create the output image based on a single pixel or the histogram of the whole image

Spatial Filtering
- Makes use of a local neighborhood to generate the new image
  z = T(f(x, y))

    Convolution Operator
      g(x, y) = f(x, y) * w(x, y) = sum_s sum_t w(s, t) f(x-s, y-t)
    - w is called a filter / kernel
    - The output value is a weighted sum of input pixels
    - This operation depends on the filter size

    Cross Correlation
      g(x, y) = f(x, y) * w(x, y) = sum_s sum_t w(s, t) f(x+s, y+t)
    - Differs from the convolution by changing subtraction to sum

        Smoothing
        - Mean filter
        - The new pixel is the average of itself and its neighbors
            - It can be arithmetic or weighted mean

        Gaussian filter
        - The weight is given by a gaussian curve
          w(x, y) = 1/2pi sigma² * e^-[x² + y²]/2sigma²
        - sigma is the variance of the distribution
        - sigma² is the standard deviation

    Differential Filter
    - Used to compute transitions on intensities
    - Related to the derivative of the function
      df/dx = f(x+1) - f(x)
      d²f/dx² = f(x+1) - 2f(x) + f(x-1)
